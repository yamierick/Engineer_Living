This folder is where all the lessons and activities I made for the Sci Res program will be stored.
The best activities where the light trading competition (where students had to buy and sell industries associated with the light spectrum 
i.e. cell phones, TV, etc.), the city building game, flotilla, and the simple card based economics game. 
The flotilla game uses my monocentric model in R and adjusts inputs based on what the different groups invest in. 
It clearly illustrates how carbon taxes, traffic, parks, etc. affect a cities growth and carbon footprint.

The card based supply and demand game I got from CMU and it elegantly introduces students to the ideas they need to play most of my games.Â 


The autonomous physics lesson houses the instructions for the city building game and the card based economics game along with others.
The Spring lesson play houses the flotilla game and the light trading game.

Enjoy.
