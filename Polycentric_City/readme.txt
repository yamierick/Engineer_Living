This folder is dedicated to a project where I attempted to update the monocentric model to account for 
Dispersed Employers, Highways, and Trafficâ€™s Effect on Urban Form.
Since there is quite a bit of randomness in traffic, this is actually a simulation model that used an RNG to simulate traffic. 
Those results where then applied to the modified monocentric city model.

It was an interesting project for me performed mostly in R. 
The code and report are here.
Enjoy.
